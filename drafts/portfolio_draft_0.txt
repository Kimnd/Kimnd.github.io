Couponing Website

While incomplete, this project was the brainchild of three late nights in a row where a copuoner and I got to talking. She'd been considering making a website for couponers based in San Francisco for a long time, and when I mentioned I happened to have a Computer Science degree I wasn't using, wanted to know if I could design a website for her. Ultimately it didn't really pan out, but there were quite a few things that I learned!

Managing client expectations

Before making any sketches, I sat down with my client to ascertain her goals with this project. The two main ones were were to build a community of Bay Area couponers and to provide a resource for people who are just getting into couponing so as to save them money. She also stressed a desire to avoid directly connecting herself to the project for safety reasons. Another value she wanted to instill in the site was that of accessibility and "lack of bullshit".
All of these were very understandable, but I found that as I dug deeper into what she really wanted, I needed to... manage her expectations a bit. The best example of this was when she discussed building a community with this website. I pointed out that 'building a community' was entirely possible without making a whole website from scratch--that's what software like Facebook and Discord are for. She had tried such things before, and said that Facebook groups became too difficult to manage after a specific size, and that software like Discord isn't suitable for people of older demographics.
Those were important issues to take into account for the website's design:
- the demographic should be able to use the site on mobile
- the site needed to be able to handle many language translations
- it should be intuitive (or at least understandale) for an older demographic of users, since couponers tend to skew in that direction
-
