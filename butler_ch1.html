    <h1>Chapter 0: The Power of a Good Night's Sleep</h1>
    <p>Sleep was not something I had taken part in for a long time. Having your consciousness linger after death by being supernaturally embedded in the physical remains of your body is funny like that.</p><p>When I'd 'died' it had felt like almost no time had passed. No slow slide into unconsciousness, no dreams, no grogginess. One moment I was being literally torn to pieces by teams of sorcerers, and the next I was beneath the light of a full moon, nothing between me and thousands (thousands of thousands, as I now know) of innocents just aching to have their blood spill. I could tell that time had passed thanks to the quality of the air, the sense of the land, that sort of thing. But I, strictly speaking, was not around for those thousand years.</p><p>So it came as a bit of a shock to my system that, now that I was trapped in the body of a normal teen boy, I had to sit around and do nothing for roughly eight hours every single day. At least when the brat is awake I can occupy myself by focusing on the sensations he's experiencing, the things going on around him, I can speak to him, whether physically or directly in his head informing him about how annoying he is.</p><p>But when he falls asleep it's just me and a paralyzed body.</p><p>I could Enchain him when he was in this state, of course, which I'd already done plenty of times. Unfortunately in doing so I'd inadvertently discovered that humanity had been busy developing something called 'surveillance cameras' in my time away. Luckily nobody realized it was specifically me possessing him, and the idiot just assumed he'd been sleepwalking. But with no idea where Satoru Gojo may be at any moment, and with nothing specifically that I even wanted to do, I'd just been letting the idiot keep his body for himself. For now.</p><p>So here I was, the greatest Curse ever known to human kind, bored out of my mind because some teenager was sleeping. I'd been keeping myself occupied at night primarily by experimenting with Cursed Energy. While being trapped in another's body was mostly an inconvenience, a bit of exploration showed that there were interesting depths to be mined from this unique situation.</p><p>At one point, it had occurred to me to see if I could activate a Domain Expansion while the brat was sleeping. Deep in meditation on my throne I concentrated on the murky stirrings of the boy's thoughts. I can't read them directly (unfortunately), but I could sense roughly his state of mind. I'd liken it to how, even if your eyes are closed you can still sense whether it's day or night. Right now he was deep in sleep--definitely dreaming. Perfect--if anything went wrong he would undoubtedly write it off as a simple nightmare.</p><p>Even though this was just a mental representation of myself, I still brought my fingers together as I called forth Malevolent Shrine. Failing to follow the physical rituals for Curse Techniques tended to have subtle but significant consequences. I smirked as I felt the power drag the boy's mind into my sphere of influence. I also made sure to shrink it down to roughly the radius of the boy's room--didn't need anybody stumbling into what I was up to by accident.</p><p>"Ok so Fushiguro, you want burgers, and Jennifer you said you wanted sa...lmon?.." For a moment the idiot peered around in shock at my own Domain. I couldn't help a gleeful grin--this was a level of potential torment I had been totally unaware of! I raised my hand, preparing a Dismantle. He'd probably be so finely chopped it would look like ground meat.</p><p>The next moment my mind fractured. I saw myself standing there, arm raised, and felt equal fear and anger rising in my stomach at the sight of a total stranger wearing my face. And yet I could still see the kid standing there and feel my hand make the gesture to attack.</p><p>"Hey!" I dodged, and cried out in pain at the nick in the arm the attack made. I growled in frustration at such a sloppy move--but the gash in my shoulder--it's not mine--"What'd you do with my friends!?" A hot mess of emotions filled me as I rushed at the pink-haired shrine priest.</p><p>Fists lit with Cursed Energy came far closer than they should've as I tried to fight off this... whatever this child's mind attack was. How the hell does somebody so untalented inflict an illusion this sophisticated on <em>me</em>? As I fumed about this, I finally managed to land a hit on the silent doppelg√§nger! He'd pay for-space itself began to bleed.</p><p>Smoke, rot, and cooked flesh filled my nostrils as I launched yet another sorcerer's head merrily away! Satisfaction filled me as I relished their disbelief that some nobody--The burning smell of meat made me choke, and horror rose up as I saw I was killing somebody <em>no NO!</em> the face suddenly became Mahito's  mutated humans, begging me to kill them, no, please, don't make me do it again--I quickly dispatched the disgusting creatures clinging to me, whatever they were as I passed the signature scent of my favorite noodle shop and decided to enter, wondering why it had been so long since I'd stopped by--the warmth of soup curled up and mingled with cut flowers and antiseptic as I entered the hospital room and grandpa grumbled that I'd gotten salmon and I felt a horrible pang of loss as I remembered "Don't die like me, kid--die surrounded by loved ones" HAHAHA what that's not funny it's fucking hilarious NO IT ISN'T I felt a hole in my chest and looked up at Fushiguro and I grinned as I imagined cutting him up WHAT <em>NO</em> blood gushed out of the wound, he didn't regret saving me, I deserve to exist, it's okay, it was worth it, I felt myself dying, no way, I can't die, there's so much left to do, so many people to kill, no, so much more pain to cause, NO, yes!, GET <em><strong>OUT-</strong></em>!</p><p>---</p><p>--</p><p>-</p><p>I crashed into the pile of skulls--but I hardly felt it, focused as I was on remembering that I was, in fact, myself--I'm Ryomen Sukuna, not some punk kid with a hero complex.</p><p>Gathering myself, I cautiously probed around for his mind. He'd woken up, and judging by the shaking, could remember something of what had just transpired. "W-what the fuck.." He rubbed at his face and I manifested a mouth out of habit. "ugh, what do <em>you</em> want.." Then I didn't have anything to say. I retreated silently.</p>
