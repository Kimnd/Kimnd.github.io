        <h2>Light's Start a Riot!!</h2>
        <p><a href="https://vestedgrammar.itch.io/lights-start-a-riot">Light's Start a Riot!!</a> <em>Credited as Fivth Gallagher, with the contribution of: concept development, spritework, general story, moral support, word arguer.</em>
        <div>
        <p> A one-bit game about Alic the Alicanto living a peaceful life in the Chilean mountains... until one dark night, when riot police decide to storm her peaceful existence!</p>
        <p>During the day you can place whimsical, like-minded folks in the landscape. Chat with them to discover their opinions about politics, natural disasters, and who's the goodest of boys.</p>
        <p>When night falls, your lovely plumage and your mountain home are the only natural sources of light. To keep the fuzz at bay, you'll need to deploy a variety of characters.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Light sources will keep your friends' morale up so that they can better keep up the fight.</li><li>Each of your fiends is vulnerable to the riot police! The bullets may be rubber, but the toll it takes is no joke. Keep an eye that your friends are still okay, and not a smoking pile of rubble and sadness in the dark.</li><li>The police will approach in a variety of ways--about six of them! Choose which one speaks to you in a highly intuitive menu.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by our little corner of the internet! Please enjoy your time with Alic and her friends.</p>

      <h2>Mewnion UωU</h2>
      <p><a href="https://thefifth.itch.io/mewnion">Mewnion</a> <em>Credited as Fiff Gallagher for art and narritive design.</em> <div>Snack is a snake-cat-coil thing of few words. None, really. Snacc bounces serenely while contemplating snacc's world. It's snacc's passion for bringing folks together that brought snacc to Catfé, the cat cafe; specifically, to advocate for unionization!</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Explore the Catfé from multiple perspectives--two of them. Wowzer!!</li>
        <li>Help the Catfé's charming workers overcome their reluctance to join the Mewnion</li>
        <li>Be serenaded by some blipipity and blorpity music :3</li>
      </ul>
      <div>Please enjoy your stay at the singular Catfé. There's definitely not another cat cafe with that name. Really. Don't google it. I'm certain nobody else has thought of that. </div>
