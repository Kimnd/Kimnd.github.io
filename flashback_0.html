    <h1>Reality Check</h1>
    <p>"I know this is probably a shock..."</p>
    <p>Katsuki peered, again, at the x-ray of his own foot. After a moment, he slapped his hand against the magazine he had in his lap. "But it looks just like the one that people with quirks do! I'm supposed to have a quirk!"</p>
    <p>The doctor sighed. "It's true, you have the bone structure of a quirk'd person--even so, that isn't a guarantee. It's unusual, but lots of people have this," she pointed to the x-ray, "and still end up never manifesting a quirk."</p>
    <p>You feel your dad lay a hand on your shoulder. "It's okay, Katsuki. You're still perfectly healthy, right?" He glanced to the doctor, who nodded.</p>
    <p>"Absolutely!" The look she gives you makes your stomach turn--it was the same look everybody was giving Deku when they realized he was quirkless.</p>
    <p>You throw the magazine in the doctor's stupid, pitying face. "But I don't wanna be <em>healthy</em>, I WANT A QUIRK!" </p>
    <p>"Katsuki!" Your dad accepts the magazine from the doctor. "Apologize right now, that wasn't okay."</p>
    <p>You glare at the doctor. She's still looking at you like you're Deku. But your dad is giving you the 'no TV before bed' look. "Sorry."</p>
    <p>"Sorry for what?" UGHHH</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry for throwing a book at you."</p>
    <p>"Thank you, Katsuki, I accept your apology," That sounded as fake to you as your own apology did.</p>
    <p>Then a bunch of adult stuff happens. Your dad stands around talking to the grownups, usually behind desks, and puts some stuff in his phone. All the while there's this weird feeling in your stomach that you can't describe. Whatever it is, you don't like it. It's like everybody is looking at you, and they all know what the doctor said.</p>
    <p>In the car on the way home, you think more about what the doctor said. What it means. Are you really going to be like useless, defenseless Izuku? Your stomach clenches in dread at the idea. As you watch the town go by, you decide to go to a higher source of knowledge. "Dad... was the doctor right? Am I really never gonna get a quirk?"</p>
    <p>He sighs. You can't see his face. "It seems so," There's a pause before he adds, "I'm sorry, son. I know you were really dead-set on it. But... sometimes life just isn't fair."</p>
    <p>~~~</p>
    <p>Things didn't change right away. Tsukun and Patrick kept hanging out with you, and Deku kept following you around too. Deku even had the audacity to keep looking down on you--as if the two of you being quirkless made you equals somehow! You could get yourself out of a damn river on your own, thank you very much.</p>
    <p>But one day when you declared that today everybody was going to the playground to see the new swings, Patrick and Tsukun didn't follow. You frown. "Guys, let's go!"</p>
    <p>They looked at each other. Tsukun piped up first. "Look, Kacchan... I don't know if we should play together anymore."</p>
    <p>That stomach clenching feeling was back. You're not dumb--you could hear the other kids making fun of them just as well as anybody. Deku, on the other hand, sounded genuinely shocked. "What!? Why not?"</p>
    <p>You snort. "What, you'd rather play with <em>those</em> idiots?" You turn on the spot. "Fine. Go ahead and flap your wings and poke 'em with your creepy fingers, see if I care!"</p>
    <p>Behind you, Patrick comments, "They aren't <em>creepy</em>!" before Tsukun adds "Fine! Go boss someone lame like <em>you</em> around instead!"</p>
    <p>That stops you in your tracks. Your whole body feels hot. You spin on your heel and march right back up to him, "Are you saying I'm weak? Huh?" You shove him to the ground and scream "<em>IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING</em>?"</p>
    <p>There's a weak "Please, don't fight!" in the background, but you don't hear it. You're too busy being yanked to the side.</p>
    <p>Patrick's got his fingers wrapped around your upper arm. "Hey, don't act like you're better than us, Kacchan!" You quickly twist your arm so he releases his grip, but you can see Tsukun getting back up out of the corner of your eye. "It's not like you've got a quirk to back you up."</p>
    <p>You sneer "I don't need a quirk to take <em>you</em> on!" before rushing straight for Patrick.</p>
    <p>'Take Patrick down first' isn't much of a plan, but it's the only one you really have--you always thought his quirk wasn't as good as Tsukun's. You duck under some fingers and tackle him to the ground. For a few moments you feel on top of the world as you punch him a bunch!</p>
    <p>But then something grabs you around the waist and starts lifting you into the sky. You try to elbow Tsukun in the face, and he shouts "Argh! Geez, ow! Kacchan, quit it!" You can hear the flapping of his wings as you go higher, and out of the corner of your eye you see the ground getting farther away.</p>
    <p>You'd never been afraid of heights before--but in those situations, it was because you'd climbed up on something high, or got on a so-called scary ride. This was out of your control.</p>
    <p>In response to the fear threatening to claw up your throat, you begin thrashing as wildly as you can, making sure to kick and push too. "PUT ME DOWN YOU ASSHOLE!"</p>
    <p>He lets go.</p>
    <p>For a moment, the world is totally still. You notice your own labored breathing and the refreshing breeze that hadn't been present on the ground. An old man makes brief eye contact with you from the window of the building across the street. Then gravity takes hold of you again and you glance down. You didn't mean to--maybe it was an instinctual thing. For some reason, Deku was next to Patrick. That's all you're able to absorb before air rushes past you and you only have a moment to straighten your legs to meet the ground beforTHOK</p>
    <p>It's startling more than anything--but that's enough for Tsukun to start kicking you as you're trying to regain your bearings. The pain doesn't let you think. You don't try to get away or beat him anymore because now all you can do is curl in a ball and hope the pain stops.</p>
    <p>After a long time, it does. "Bored now--c'mon, let's go," Cicadas chirp as you concentrate on breathing. Eventually you manage to sit up--slowly and painfully, but it happens. To your annoyance, but not shock, Deku is still on his back a few feet away.</p>
    <p>For a while, you just sit there. You.. <em>lost</em>. "...alright? Kaachan?"</p>
    <p>You glare at him--he's still looking at you like you're weak--and growl "I'm <em>fine</em>," but to your horror, your voice is cracking like you're about to cry. You quickly scrub the heel of your hand over your eyes.</p>
    <p>If he notices, he doesn't comment and you're silently grateful. "Oh, okay," You finally get to your feet. </p>
    <p>After a brief stagger you're fine, and you growl, "<em>Don't</em>" at Deku when he moves to help hold you up.</p>
    <p>"But-"</p>
    <p>"Don't FUCKING touch me, shitty Deku."</p>
    <p>Deku's eyes go wide, covering his mouth as he gasps. For a moment you wonder if that was a little mean. Then, he whispers, "Kacchan! you're not supposed to say that word!"</p>
    <p>After a moment you smirk and say, "What, you mean.." you cup your hands around your mouth, "FUCK?" He practically squeaks, and you laugh. Deku does too and... it's actually kinda nice.</p>
    <p>Eventually, "So what do you wanna do now Kaachan?" After a moment's thought, you decide to abandon your earlier plan.</p>
    <p>"Let's go back home. I'm hungry."</p>
    <p>This makes Deku perk up. "Oh! My mom made cookies yesterday, let's go to my house!"</p>
    <p>You shove him. "You don't pick what we do, Deku!" After a pause where Deku looks like he's about to whine about you being mean, you add "But that's an okay plan. I guess," Of course he looks like he's about to burst into tears, so you punch him. "You'd BETTER not cry, Deku."</p>
    <p>"Ow! If you hit me, of course I'm gonna cry!"</p>
    <p>You hit him again. "Then stop being such a crybaby!"</p>
    <p>He sniffles. "Well... you can't hit me if you can't catch me!" Before sprinting off. "See you at my house, Kacchan!"</p>
    <p>You're caught off guard, but you catch up. And win. Obviously.</p>
    <p>The cookies were very tasty.</p>
    <p>~~~</p>
    <p>Even years later you remember the shouting match that erupted when you came home beat up. After cleaning and putting some stinging stuff on the cuts, your mom let you have it. "What were you THINKING, Katsuki!"</p>
    <p>"They started it!"</p>
    <p>She snorted. "Oh trust me son, I do NOT care who started it--you finished it!" You opened your mouth to shout something before closing it again. That feeling was back, this time because you <em>hadn't</em> finished it. Even with quirks as weak as theirs... She sighed. "Why can't you be more like Izuku? Inko never has these kinds of problems."</p>
    <p>"Maybe you'd rather have <em>him</em> for a son than me!"</p>
    <p>"Maybe I WOULD, shithead!"</p>
    <p>Dad shouts, "That's twenty-five cents, Mitsuki," from the other room while you laugh at her.</p>
    <p>"Ah, alright kiddo, you got me," she gives you an affectionate noogie before her face turns serious again. "But don't do that again, understand?" You nod--next time, you're not gonna lose.</p>
