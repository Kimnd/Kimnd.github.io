    <h3>Karkat: Lead.</h3>

    <p>You take a deep breath. Feferi needs your guidance, clearly. Even though you have no fucking Alternanian idea what the hell you're doing. "<span class="karkat">Ok, Feferi.. first, do you have ANY healing fraymotiefs?</span>" She stares at you like you're speaking some crazy Earth language. You point to Sollux. "<span class="karkat">If either of them are still..</span>" you blink. Squeeze your eyes shut. You can't say it. You can't fucking say it. Instead you wave your hand. "<span class="karkat">I'LL CHECK KANAYA!</span>"</p>

    <p>You can hear her scrambling up and over to her erstwhile matesprite. And as much as you try, you can't keep the tears in as your hands slip in Kanaya's blood while you check her pulse. There's... there's nothing. "<span class="feferi">Oh... Sollux...</span>" Guess Feferi is discovering the same thing. You grip Kanaya's shoulder, staring into her slack face. It's a long shot. You know it's almost impossible... but you try to kiss her back anyway. Please don't be dead please don't be dead PLEASE don't be dead...</p>

    <p>Nope. You wipe your eyes as you lay her down and get back to your feet. "<span class="karkat">Ok, well, we'd better WHAT THE FUCK!</span>" Feferi is leaning over Eridan again.</p>

    <p>She looks up at you, the tears flowing freely down her face, but she's SMILING? "<span class="feferi">He's still alive! I can--</span>" She reaches out to him. You can even hear the beginning of... some sort of Life thing.</p>

    <p>You shove her back. "<span class="karkat">FEFERI ARE YOU UTTERLY OUT OF YOUR THINKPAN!???</span>" God, she looks all hurt. "<span class="karkat">You JUST,</span>" You kick Eridan, and are rewarded by a clear flinch and gasp of pain, "<span class="karkat">...saw this psycho kill TWO GODDAMN PEOPLE! Not to fucking MENTION destroy ANY FUCKING HOPE of our species actually fucking SURVIVING AT ALL!</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="feferi">But, but he's alive! Karkat, we can't just let him...</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="karkat">UM I AM PRETTY FUCKING SURE WE CAN, IN FACT, JUST LET HIM!</span>"</p>

    <p>She stares down at him, a weird mix of emotions you can't read. "<span class="feferi">I... I know, but. PLEASE! I'll...</span>" she brightens. "<span class="feferi">We can lock him in that cell we found!</span>"</p>

    <p>You shake your head. You are having a discussion about saving the WORST TROLL YOU KNOW. "<span class="karkat">Come on you KNOW somebody that high up could escape from something like that!</span>" Glancing back down at the gruesome soon-to-be-a-corpse, there is now blood gurgling up from his mouth as he tries to say something. "<span class="karkat">SHUT THE FUCK UP AMPORA.</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="feferi">Karkat!</span>" She's staring at you with a resolution that frightens you. "<span class="feferi">I CANNOT let him die.</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="karkat">AAAAAAAGHHHH</span>" You pace for a few moments, grabbing at your hair. The sheer LUNACY on display here! If you didn't know any better you'd say you're the only sane fucker on this dumb meteor. A notification on one of the deskhusks catches your attention. Fucking FINALLY, it's about gogdamn time Gamzee answered you! "<span class="karkat">OKAY, OKAY...</span>" You take a deep breath that you regret when the clashing smells of blood hit your scentsponge. "<span class="karkat">JUST... Just give me a second.</span>"</p>
