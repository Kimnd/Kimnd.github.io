    <p>She sighs as she reads over your shoulder. "<span class="feferi">Well T)(AT went as well as I remember..."</span></p>

    <p>Your hand meets your face very swiftly. FUCK. "<span class="karkat">I swear Feferi, I would WRING that FUCKER'S neck myself if I wasn't PANTSSHITTINGLY TERRIFIED RIGHT NOW!!!"</span></p>

    <p>You spin around. Luckily, the murderer is in the same place you left him. "<span class="feferi">Don't worry! I -ENS)(OR-ED he would stay passed out for an )(OUR, at least."</span></p>

    <p>You glance at her ascance. "<span class="karkat">And you did that... HOW exactly?"</span></p>

    <p>She blinks. Looks at you with wonderment. "<span class="feferi">You know I'm not S)(OR-E! Maybe it's some sort of Life thing? Or a Witch thing?"</span></p>

    <p>"<span class="karkat">Last I checked I didn't get magical knowledge about how blood works just because that's my Aspect."</span></p>

    <p>"<span class="feferi">)(U)(! That's true!</span>" She sighs with a wistfulness you only usually hear in the cheesiest of romcoms when the matespriteship is on a beautiful Alternian beach instead of a room full of corpses as a clown with a god complex rampages outside. And you're not even sure which one you're talking about, har har har. "<span class="feferi">I wish we could've played this game longer, sometimes. It was so ---EXCITING!"</span></p>

    <p>"<span class="karkat">Hm yes. Exciting INDEED! Except for the part where most of us are probably going to be FUCKING DEAD and even if we survive, we're stuck on a meteor that's hurtling toward certain DEATH! Yeah other than that it was a fucking HOOT and a HALF for sure,</span>" You shake yourself loose from this wallowing. It may be nearly dead but damnit you have a team to try and lead. "<span class="karkat">Alright, Gamzee clearly knows where we are... but we need to find out who else is alive and regroup. Grab whatever portable communications you can carry, alright?"</span></p>

    <p>She nods, captchaloguing away her trident. As you're captchaloguing any computers, you hear her add "<span class="feferi">But.. what about...</span>" She's looking at Sollux and Kanaya.</p>

    <p>There is NOT a catch in your voice. There fucking ISN'T, OKAY? "<span class="karkat">We'll.. we'll just leave them for now. Gamzee can't kill them a second time."</span></p>

    <p>"<span class="feferi">And what about -ERIFIN?</span>" You stare at her. "<span class="feferi">...okay, uh. Y---ES I suppose he could probably handle himself in that situation, good point WIS-E L-EAD-ER!!!"</span></p>

    <p>"<span class="karkat">THANK you."</span></p>
