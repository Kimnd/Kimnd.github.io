        <h2>Prince: Revive the Mage</h2>
    <p>You finger your scarf nervously as you examine Sol's dead body. You're no forensics expert but it looks like his skull hit the wall at a funny angle so a piece of it got lodged in his thinkpan. The tangy odor of yellow blood has permeated the space alongside the copious amounts of purple and jade still pooling on the floor. Is it possible for somebody to look smug while dead? Because you kind of can't help but think Sol is fucking taunting you even with his eyes closed.</p>
    <p>"<span class="eridan">Come ON, Dawe SAID it wwas the best thin to do, for fucks sake!!</span>" You smack yourself, "<span class="eridan">Owwww!</span>" clonking yourself with a ring. Hey... actually...</p>
    <p>You remove the ring in question, and place it on Sol's chest. You hold your breath... ERROR! INSUFFICIENT WORTH. "<span class="eridan">Ok, owiously that wwouldn't wwork...</span>" Wishful thinking. You try three more, your favorites. ERROR! "<span class="eridan">Come on, fuckin wwwwork!</span>" You eventually have all six of the ones you didn't give up in the game tumbled around him and you keep getting the error message.</p>
    <p>You glare at Sol. "<span class="eridan">Man I bet you wwont ewen fuckin wwanna keep any a this shit!!</span>" He doesn't reply. Because he's dead. Ugh. You know what you need to do. Slowly, reluctantly, you unwind your scarf.</p>
    <p>It's pretty battered, given all the crap the game put you through. Half of it is even covered in your blood thanks to your earlier 'death'. And there's still some bright-red angel blood too, though that's harder to see on the blue fabric. But you've had this for sweeps. "<span class="eridan">Fef got me this for our first swweep bein moirails...</span>" Tears well up, and you sniff. Nobody's around to hear you anyway, so what the fuck ever. "<span class="eridan">That wwas around wwhen I.. stopped goin in deep wwater so much. An she said...</span>" You wipe at your face with a chewed-up sleeve. "<span class="eridan">She said it wwould remind me a the ocean. Ewen wwhen I wwasn't in it, you knoww?</span>" You're half convinced Feferi doesn't even remember what the hell she said, that she just gave you a nice gift and didn't think much of it. But it meant something to you then, and so you incorporated it into your life. You already feel uncomfortable just standing here without it.</p>
    <p>You glance up and dread fills your gastrointestinal worms to remember who the fuck this is all for. GOD do you not want to fucking save this guy. "<span class="eridan">...guess I gotta suck it up or wwhatewer,</span>" You sigh, fold the scarf, and place it gently on his torso. Out of respect for how long you've had it. Instantly, gruesome noises of thinkpan and bone re-growing faster than should be possible meet your hearing ducts. "<span class="eridan">You better be fuckin wworth it, Sol,</span>" You growl. Then you remember Dave's silly thing about coolness. "<span class="eridan">Ok wwell you are cool. At least by Dawe's wway a thinkin about cool. So.</span>"</p>
    <p>And with that positively stirring speech you turn to go--"<span class="eridan">AWW SHIT! Fuck I shoulda healed Kan instead!! She's AWWESOME, oh cod FUCKIN DAMNIT,</span>" You stomp over to the transportilizer, muttering to yourself. You do NOT want to be here when Sol wakes up.</p>
