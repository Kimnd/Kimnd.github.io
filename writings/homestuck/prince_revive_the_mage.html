    <h3>Prince: Revive the Mage.</h3>
    <p>You finger your scarf nervously as you examine Sollux's dead body. You're no forensics expert but it looks like his skull hit the wall at a funny angle so a piece of it got lodged in his thinkpan. The tangy odor of yellow blood clashes terribly with the copious amounts of purple and jade still pooling on the floor. Is it possible for somebody to look smug while dead? Because if it is Sol absolutely is. Even if his head is lolling oddly to on side.</p>
    <p>"<span class="eridan">Come ON, Dawe SAID it wwas the best thin to do, for fucks sake!!</span>" You smack yourself, "<span class="eridan">Owwww!</span>" clonking yourself with a ring. Hey... actually...</p>

    <p>You remove the ring in question, and place it on Sol's chest. You hold your breath... ERROR! INSUFFICIENT WORTH. "<span class="eridan">Ok, obwiously that wwouldn't wwork...</span>" Wishful thinking. You try three more, your favorites. ERROR! "<span class="eridan">Come on, fuckin wwwwork!</span>" You eventually have all six of the ones you didn't give up in the game tumbled around him and you keep getting the error message.</p>

    <p>You glare at Sol. "<span class="eridan">Man I bet you wwont ewen fuckin wwanna keep any a this shit!!</span>" He doesn't reply. Because he's dead. Ugh. You know what you need to do. Slowly, reluctantly... you unwind your scarf.</p>

    <p>It's pretty battered, given all the crap this game's put you through. Half of it's been soaking in your blood for Gog-knows how long, and there's still plenty of bright-red angel blood too. You brush a thumb over the soft fibers of spitbeast wool. Tears sting your eyes as the sweeps flood into your memory.</p>

    <p>"<span class="eridan">Fef got me this for our first swweep bein moirails...</span>" You sniff a little as it overflows and you begin crying in earnest. Nobody's around to hear you anyway, so what the fuck ever. "<span class="eridan">That wwas around wwhen I.. stopped goin in deep wwater so much. An she said...</span>" You wipe at your face with a chewed-up sleeve. "<span class="eridan">She said it wwould remind me a the ocean. Ewen wwhen I wwasn't in it, you knoww?</span>" You're half convinced Feferi doesn't even remember what the hell she said, that she just gave you a nice gift and didn't think much of it. But it meant something to you then, so you incorporated it into your life. You already feel uncomfortable just standing here without it.</p>

    <p>You glance up and dread fills your gastrointestinal worms to remember who the fuck this is all for. GOD do you not want to fucking save this guy. "<span class="eridan">...guess I gotta suck it up or wwhatewer,</span>" You sigh, fold the scarf, and place it gently on his torso. Out of respect for how much it meant to you. Instantly, gruesome noises of thinkpan and bone re-growing faster than should be possible meet your hearing ducts. "<span class="eridan">You better be fuckin wworth it, Sol,</span>" You growl. Then you remember Dave's silly thing about coolness. "<span class="eridan">Ok wwell you are cool. At least by Dawe's wway a thinkin about cool. So.</span>"</p>

    <p>And with that positively stirring speech you turn to go. You do NOT want to be here when he wakes up. There's a splash and you realize you've stepped in the pool of green--"<span class="eridan">AWW SHIT! Fuck I shoulda healed Kan instead!! She's AWWESOME, oh cod FUCKIN DAMNIT-</span>" You shake the blood off and stomp over to the transportilizer, grumbling to yourself all the way.</p>
