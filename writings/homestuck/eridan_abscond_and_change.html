    <h3>Eridan: Abscond and change.</h3>
    <p>You don't have a mirror, but you are in a fucking state and a half. Your shirt's been torn to shreds where Fef stabbed you, and your pants are crusty from laying in the pool of your blood so long. Even that aside, you're exhausted. Whatever Fef did to heal you must've sapped at your strength because there's an itchyness behind your eyes you recognize from sleepless nights on extra-intense Flarp campeigns. You can't wait to climb into your recuperacoon and--</p>
    <p>Oh. Right. A spike of homesickness goes through you as you trudge the hallways, trying to find the way back to your block. All these fucking places look the same. Eventually one of the hallways opens out into a big room. Shit. Where the fuck are you?</p>
    <p>Your fins perk at a slight noise behind you. Your specibus is in your hand in a second as you scan the area. You don't need to look hard. It's Vris, with her fancy fucking fairy wings. What the fuck does she want? Did... she didn't hear about Kan, did she?... "<span class="vriska">My my, Dualscar. You're a sorry sight.</span>"</p>
    <p>She lands gracefully, dice casually-but-threateningly in her hand. "<span class="eridan">Yeah don't fuckin remind me Wris,</span>" you scratch at your bare neck.</p>
    <p>A chuckle. "<span class="vriska">Not even your shitty scarf?</span>" Oh goddamnit your eyes feel itchy again. "<span class="vriska">Don't think I've ever even seen you without that dum8 thing!</span>"</p>
    <p>You can feel your lip trembling from keeping tears in. "<span class="eridan">S-shut up, wwould you?</span>" It's one thing to cry on your own, but in front of your ex?</p>
    <p>"<span class="vriska">WOW what a GR88888888T come8ack!</span>" She bares her teeth in that old way she did and. Shit, something about it just. Hits. Nothing is the same. Nothing will ever BE the same, EVERYTHING you knew is fucking GONE. "<span class="vriska">I 8et--</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="eridan">I JUST WWANNA FUCKIN GO HOME!</span>" You don't bother wiping at your face. You'll never live this down anyway. "<span class="eridan">I wwanna wwatch mowies an not giwe a shit about killin people an an an FUCK this stupid fuckin game it wwas BULLSHIT!</span>"</p>
    <p>Vriska seems to actually be taken aback by your outburst. "<span class="vriska">........are you... crying?</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="eridan">WWOOOOOOWW Wris you're sooooooo fuckin obserwant! If they wwere handin out awwards for best at noticin stuff you'd be top a the list alongside somebody pointin out that the ocean is FUCKIN wwet!!</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="vriska">Some8ody is 8eing a little HUMAN-SARCASTIC, hmmmmmmmm Ampora?</span>" She's probably adopted a human of her own to pick up on that. "<span class="vriska">If this is you growing the shameglo8es to challenge me for our final showdown--</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="gamzee">honk</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="vriska">--you really picked a weird time--</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="gamzee">HONK</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="vriska">--too--</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="eridan">Oh shut your DAM squawwk gaper--</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="gamzee">honk</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="eridan">--Wris! I don't giwe a shit aboat--</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="gamzee">MOTHERFUCKIN,</span>" That makes you both turn. "<span class="gamzee">...honk.</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="vriska">...uh. Gamzee? We're kind of 8usy?</span>"</p>
    <p>You can't help but notice he's wearing something on his head. "<span class="eridan">Hey, shit, that's... fuck wwhat's her name...</span>" You knuckle your forehead. "<span class="eridan">Neopet? Shit. No that aint it..</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="vriska">Oh my Gooooooood Eridan you are so fucking dum88888888!!!!</span>" Vris has started cackling, compensating for her lack of balence by floating like the God-tier she is.</p>
    <p>"<span class="gamzee">SHIT MOTHERFUCKER YOU GOT IT!</span>" Gamzee yells, startling you both. "<span class="gamzee">the kittycat has taken her final nap,</span>" You subtly adjust your wand to be pointing at him. Just. Yknow, in case. "<span class="gamzee">WHERE SHE AND HER DUMBASS MUSCLEBEAST FUCKER FUCKING BELONG!</span>" He activates his strife specibus, whatever the fuck it is. "<span class="gamzee">and i have decided. ITS WHERE YOU TWO ASSHOLES BELONG--</span>" a blur of movement. "<span class="gamzee">HOOOOOOooooonk</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="eridan">...wwhat the--</span>"</p>
    <p>"<span class="vriska">H8Y--</span>" a clattering noise, and Vris is now skidding across the concrete. You finally get a look at the blur.</p>
    <p>"<span class="eridan">Wwhat, KAN!? You're--</span>" she's in your space faster than you can process and CRUNCH. "<span class="eridan">AAAAA</span>" There goes your wand. And your fingers. You get a brief moment to process the RAGE in her face before white-hot agony more intense even than Fef's attack cuts through you.</p>
