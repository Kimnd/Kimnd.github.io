    <p>(page <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story/3358">3358</a>)</p>

    <p>Oh no. Oh God no. "<span class="karkat">Ok, that. Is FUCKING TERRIFYING,</span>" You turn back to the room at large. And find Feferi... "<span class="karkat">OH NO NO NO NO!</span>" But it's too late. You can fucking HEAR the holes in his stomach knitting back together. Wow that's disgusting. "<span class="karkat">PERFECT. JUST PERFECT!</span>"</p>

    <p>At least she doesn't look happy as she lays him back down in a pool of his own grapejuice. "<span class="feferi">I know, Karkat. I'm sorry... but I can't just leave something to DI-E...</span>" She turns toward you with a look of pained apology. Then her eyebrows turn inward sympathetically. "<span class="feferi">Oh, Karkat! You're crying...</span>"</p>

    <p>SHIT FUCK JUST WHAT YOU NEED. You wipe furiously at your face. "<span class="karkat">BECAUSE GAMZEE IS ON THE LOOSE. He just told me he's going to KILL US ALL!</span>" You laugh, try to kick Eridan again, and miss. "<span class="karkat">Now we've got TWO crazed highbloods on the loose. Love my fucking life.</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="feferi">Oh... O)( NO...</span>" Her lookbulbs go wide. "<span class="feferi">Shoot, you said.... you SAID something about that! In your memo!</span>" She stands, purple on her legs, yellow on her arms. "<span class="feferi">Karkat, I'm so sorry, I didn't R-EALIZ-E..</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="karkat">Shit! Feferi you are a GENIUS!</span>"</p>
