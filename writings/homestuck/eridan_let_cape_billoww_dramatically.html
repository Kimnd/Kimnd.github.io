    <h3>Eridan: Let cape billoww dramatically.</h3>

    <p>Seeing her again after all this time makes... something twist in your acid tract. And it's NOT helped by the way that the instant Vriska spots your cape (a darker purple than you usually go with, more a twilight) billowing over the moor, she lets out a disappointed and annoyed groan. "<span class="vriska">Uuuuuuugh. Who invited YOU, Dualscar?</span>" A one-eyed eye roll. "<span class="vriska">Yourself, I assume, since surely no8ody else would've wanted you to 8e here!</span>"</p>

    <p>Shit you can see your fins turning purple. "<span class="eridan">I didnt inwite myself, Mindfang. That'd be fuckin pathetic.</span>"</p>

    <p>She laughs. Shit, you gave her an opening--"<span class="vriska">Which is exactly what you are!</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="eridan">Wwho ewen asked you?!</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="vriska">Puh-leeeeeeeease, Ophaner,</span>" She rolls her eyes before inspecting her nails. "<span class="vriska">You are soooooooo desper8 for my attention you resorted to roping Terezi in to do your dirty work!</span>"</p>

    <p>Ugh you're already messing this up. "<span class="eridan">I wwouldn't fuckin do that,</span>" Thank God you're the only two here. "<span class="eridan">Terezi inwited me, okay? I am JUST here to kill some shit. Not gonna...</span>" you gesture in a reassuring way. She lifts a single eyebrow and you end up finishing with a very lame "<span class="eridan">...y'knoww.</span>"</p>

    <p>Vriska snorts incredulously. "<span class="vriska">Terezi knew this would 8e the only chance I'd ever fucking talk to you again, didn't she,</span>" She's hardly even looked at you this whole time... like none of the passion that made her burn so fucking fiercely is directed at you anymore. She sits on a nearby boulder with a "<span class="vriska">SIIIIIIIIGH. Unlucky me, she needs feeding.</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="eridan">YEAH wwell maybe that's part of it!</span>" If you can just.. if you can JUST get that rush again, things will work out! You KNOW it. "<span class="eridan">I got a lotta feelins about you, can't fuckin blame me.</span>"</p>

    <p>She pins you with that old Serket one-eyed glare. That used to be a guaranteed way to make your blood pusher go into overtime. But it's... it's just not working like it used to for some reason. "<span class="vriska">Um, I'm pretty sure I CAN 8lame you Ampora. You're the one who just can't 8ear to move on,</span>" She props her head up on her hand. "<span class="vriska">May8e give Zahhak a shot? At least he genuinely h8es you,</span>" And she's smirking and it...</p>

    <p>It's just not fucking WORKING. And that, more than anything, terrifies you. The two of you are perfect for each other! If she's not the kissmesis you want... then that would mean the destiny you'd had in your thinkpan's lookstalks for sweeps was.. wrong. That YOU were wrong.</p>

    <p>You shake it off. That couldn't POSSIBLY be it! "<span class="eridan">He's fuckin annoyin as hell, Marquise.</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="vriska">A pl8in annoying kissmesis, huh,</span>" She's pulled out her palmhusk and isn't even rolling her eye anymore. "<span class="vriska">Don't throw 8olders in your glass hive, Eridan.</span>"</p>

    <p>If she'd just fucking PAY ATTENTION to you! Some good old kisstalk is sure to set things back to the way they should be. "<span class="eridan">Like you'we got any fuckin better pitch prospect than me. Wwho else do you ewen hate romantically? That fudgeblood you crippled?</span>" You snort, remembering the few encounters you'd had with him. "<span class="eridan">Yeah right, he's so lost in fairyland he wwouldn't ewen notice if you showwed up in sexy Wwhendy cosplay,</span>" she's STILL not looking at you. But she put her palmhusk down. "<span class="eridan">Guess that's wwhat you get aimin so loww beloww your caste, huh?</span>" A sensation of cold sweeps over you. Like a brief flash of numbness. Indignity flares up when you realize her eye is glowing. "<span class="eridan">Hey, don't fuckin mess wwith my thinkpan you bitch!</span>"</p>

    <p>"<span class="vriska">8itch or not,</span>" she stands. "<span class="vriska">I do NOT need to toler8 this kind of 8l8tant a8use from the likes of YOU, Am8ore-a,</span>" She spins on her heel to go, complete with hair-flip. "<span class="vriska">No dou8t I can drop 8y later and collect my 8ooty when you're done playing your own pretend,</span>" And you open your squawk gaper to try and convince her not to go, but. You feel nothing but relieved knowing she won't be playing. "<span class="vriska">8ye 8ye, purple pants!</span>"</p>

    <p>Now that nickname is practically guaranteed to make you feel black all the fuck over. But. It doesn't. It's... it's.. what the fuck are you feeling? Standing there with your cape flapping against your face as she becomes nothing but a navy blob on the horizon you just feel... hollow. And so, so alone.</p>
