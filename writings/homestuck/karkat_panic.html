    <h3>Karkat: PANIC.</h3>

    <p>Your jaw is on the fucking floor. In the span of about thirty Goddamn seconds, you saw Eridan Ampora punch magic--excuse you, 'science'--holes through two of your best friends. Feferi managed to stab that trident of hers into his stomach, though. Even pinned him to the ground.</p>

    <p>She's breathing pretty heavily. "<span class="karkat">UM. FUCK???</span>" She snaps her gaze to you, glancenuggets wide... oh no "<span class="karkat">Feferi, do NOT CRY, I swear TO GOD...</span>"</p>

    <p>But it's too late. "<span class="feferi">K-karkat, I... I didn't mean...</span>" Magenta droplets of liquid fall from her face as she stares down at the body.</p>
