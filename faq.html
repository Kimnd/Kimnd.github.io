        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2>Fif? Feif? Fifth? Phum? What's the name of this Irish one?</h2> <p>Couldn't get that semi-couplet outta my head. As for your question, I answer to many things! "Frankie" is my most common name, since I use it professionally, but I've been known to answer to "Franky", "Fifth", "Fred", "Pip", "Fnt", and anything that's not femme. I'll probably also answer to my deadnames (long story) though keep in mind those use cases are being depricated.</p>
        <h2>How about this pronoun stuff?</h2>
        <p>In a perfect world, I'd like people to use ä»– to refer to me, since it's a singular gender-nuetral pronoun.... but since I' am not Chinese, 'they/them' is correct for me. If you really don't like singular they, 'he/him' is okay as well.</p>
        <h2>Isn't this kind of a short list of questions?</h2>
        <p>Yeah, I was more focused on adding portfolio stuff to the site... I'll add more important stuff as I think of it.</p>
