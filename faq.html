      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h2>Fif? Feif? Fifth? Phum? What's the name of this Irish one?</h2>
        <p>Couldn't get that semi-couplet outta my head. As for your question, I answer to many things! "Frankie" is my most common name, since I use it professionally, but I've been known to answer to "Franky", "Fifth", "Fred", "Pip", "Fnt", and anything that's not femme. I'll probably also answer to my deadnames (long story) though keep in mind those use cases are being depricated.</p>
      <h2>How about this pronoun stuff?</h2>
        <p>In a perfect world, I'd like people to use ä»– to refer to me, since it's a singular gender-nuetral pronoun.... but since I' am not Chinese, 'they/them' is correct for me. If you really don't like singular they, 'he/him' is okay as well.</p>
        <!--
        <h2>Isn't this kind of a short list of questions?</h2>
        <p>Yeah, I was more focused on adding portfolio stuff to the site... I'll add more important stuff as I think of it.</p>
        -->
      <h2>What's your ideal job?</h2>
        <p>My absolutely ideal 'job' would be a Universal Basic Income in a society where everyone would be able to pursue their passions without needing to prove they should be allowed to live by, as the saying goes, "earning a living".</p>
        <p>But I do, of course, have more achievable jobs in mind! In order of most-to-least important, these are my personal criteria for an ideal job:</p>
          <ui>able to cover the mortgage on Mom's house, cell phone service, electricity, health care, water, and food</ui>
          <ui>working environment is cooperative, not competitive (eg getting packages up is cooperative by definition) </ui>
          <ui>making a product or providing a service that visibly makes people happier(e.g. "You have the patience of a saint, thank you!") </ui>
          <ui>involves going to a physical location at a predictable, not-at-night rate and time (eg predictable rate (6 days a week) time (midnight) at usps, not at night at cvs (and also predictable, same 4 days))</ui>
          <ui>related to computer science, preferably user interfaces</ui>
        <p>The other kinds of qualities I would wish for are.. fuzzier, let's say:</p>
          <ui>building game interfaces that focus on fun, character, and accessibility</ui>
          <ui>working to improve the interface of a piece of software that currently doesn't have a very good interface</ui>
        <p>I'm reluctant to put much in these lists because I'm at the beginning of my career. What if I dream of some position that doesn't exist? Here's the pieces I laid out earlier put together:</p>
        <p>My ideal job would be a position where I have decent healthcare and a good pension for many years, working with people that I like on something that's meaningful and challenging, with bosses and higherups that appreciate me and my colleagues, never asking us to crunch ourselves or others to get projects done.</p>
        <p>Does such a place exist? Would such a place want to hire me? These kinds of questions do not keep me up at night because I avoid thinking about them.</p>
      <h2>So what, you're scared that you would suck at any job?</h2>
        <p>Well, sure. I can recognize those fears as largely being irrational, but from what I've gleaned from being a human for many years and being around them, being insecure and afraid that you won't measure up is pretty normal! For me I think it largely stems from feeling like I don't have enough information to accurately assess myself. But again, this seems like a common ailment--always harder to see yourself from inside your head, y'know?</p>
