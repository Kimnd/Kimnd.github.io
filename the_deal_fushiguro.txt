The sheer stupidity of the vessel I'd found myself in  truly boggles the mind. "Fushigurooooo!" He was currently banging on Megumi's door, attempting to wake him up. I'll admit I had been annoyed when the brat turned down my offer--and believe me, I was going to keep trying (out of spite if nothing else)--but seeing if Megumi would figure out what the brat couldn't would probably prove entertaining. "Dude, I know it's late, but it's an emergency!"

A few moments after that, movement could be heard, and the door was swiftly opened. Over his tank top and sweatpants I could already see cursed energy swirling. Smart. "What's the situation?"

My vessel waved his hands goofily. "Oh no, not /that/ kind of an emergency!" He pointed down. "I just need to go to the ER because my dick won't stop being hard."

For a moment Megumi simply stared at him blankly--probably thinking about what an idiot he is. Then he let the cursed energy evaporate away. Shame, he looks much better when glowing with power. "Oh. What?" He glanced at our crotch, and frowned. "..You're... hard?" an eyebrow went up. "That /all/ that's wrong?"

The brat shrugged while I couldn't help a swell of pride; he'd sensed something. Not that I'd tried particularly hard to hide it. My vessel, meanwhile, smacked the palm of his hand against his forehead. "Well, Sukuna wouldn't shut up about it--he was acting REALLY weird!" This fucking child really is clueless. Scratching the back of his neck, he shrugged, "...probably not related, but it is annoying."

Megumi snorted. "I can imagine," Turning around he gestured into his room. "Have a seat--I'm thinking something curse-y might be involved."

At /last/ the dim candle of realization sputtered into life. "Oh shit you really think so?" Then, as Megumi snapped a light on and the brat hopped onto the bed, he added, giggling, "Can I call everything we do 'curse-y' from now on?"

"In my defense, it's four in the fucking morning," I was getting excited now--he was summoning his energy again! "You should probably take your pants and underwear off for this."

"Alright," To distract from the brat's whining I occupied myself with murmuring about all the things I couldn't wait to do to the black-haired sorcerer when he had realized his true potential; the scarlet of sunset glinting off the red of blood painting the battlefield, his eyes slowly filling with fear and desperation as he realized that even after all this time he couldn't possibly beat the King of Curses, "Uhhh.. you sure this is a good idea, Fushiguro?" hearing a symphony of crunching and screams as I took his body apart slowly..

In the present, however, he simply nodded. "Should only take a second. Your dick isn't going to fall off in the next fifteen minutes, right?" He peered at the idiot's crotch, squinting. "I could swear... hm.."

"Wh..what's going on? Can you see something?" The brat sounded terrified, as he should.

"Not sure... I thought I saw some kind of cursed residue near your crotch earlier. But now I'm not so sure."

"Well shit, that's not good!"

Megumi nodded sagely. "Pretty much, yeah."

They both stared at it for a few more moments. "..it wasn't that dark earlier. It was just kinda red at the start, you know?"

"Does it feel strange or anything?"

The vessel nodded. "It's like... you know, when you floss? And you've got the floss wrapped too tightly around your fingers but you don't notice so by the time you're done your finger is all purple?"

'Floss'? The fuck was he talking about? But Megumi seemed to understand. "Yeah I have done that," He frowned. "You know, I'd say that turning it that color is just to make it harder to see any cursed energy residue that might be there."

"Hmm. What about..." The brat summoned some power around his hand, then moved it down to his crotch. "Does that help?" ...using cursed energy as a glorified torch was possibly the stupidest solution to any problem I'd ever heard of.

Megumi hid any opinion that that was fucking dumb very well. "Hm. Not really. It's kind of..."

To my utter annoyance, the brat interrupted him. "Wait, I can see something!" He pointed with his other hand to the base of his cock. "See? it's like.. a sort of ring?" Pretty fucking disappointing that the brat had figured it out before the actual smart person in the room.

Megumi leaned in and I made sure to layer my /mmm yes closer, good../ with as much horniness as possible--even if I didn't get to have *fun* tonight, I was certainly going to make the most of it by making my vessel uncomfortable. "...no idea what you're talking about man," After a moment, he lit up his own hand in energy, and held it up. "Oh, there /is/ something..."

After a moment's study, the brat helpfully commented "Looks kinda like a cock ring."

"Do you mind if I touch it?" I felt the brat's face go red, and Megumi's face also went slightly pink. "I mean the curse. I'll try not to touch your penis."

But the brat shook his head. "No, it's ok, i trust you, Fushiguro," as Megumi began the hands-on inspection he added "I can't really feel anything anyway so that should make it less awkward, right?" I did my best to keep my eye locked on him, since the brat was looking anywhere /but/ at the sorcerer nearly touching our cock. Fucking coward.

Cursed energy flowed over him like water over a boulder in a creek. The deft movement of hands and the concentration in his face made for a delectable show. I kept up a running commentary of dirty talk in my vessel's head--it would be /so easy/ to Enchain this idiot and spend a minute doing whatever i wanted--but my fantasizing was abruptly cut short by the brat lying down! /You fucking virgin dumbass!/ he ignored me, commenting "So... see anything?.." as i unleashed a torrent of insults about his strange fear of sex.

Another few more seconds and he leaned away. A real shame. "Done. I think I get what's going on," as the vessel pulled his pants and such back up, Megumi continued, "You know the barriers we erect around active curse--"

"Eyyy," the brat did some snapping gesture with his hands that I found annoying. "Good one!"

I growled "Shut up, dumbass."

At the exact same time, Megumi gave a flat "...No." he continued, "A barrier's properties can be changed to allow some people through and others not, right? Or you can make it easy to come in but not leave?" The vessel nodded in understanding. "A barrier's been placed on your dick with those kinds of rules imposed on blood. I.e. it can go in, but it can't come out."

"Ew..." Megumi nodded in agreement and I thrilled at the fact that he'd figured it out. I doubt most people would consider it being a barrier at that scale. Speaking of stupidity, "A barrier that tiny would probably be pretty easy to take out, right?"

"Mm. No. Having hyper-specific conditions like a small area of influence and only caring about letting blood flow one way actually make it pretty strong.." Even enjoying the fruits of many boredom-fueled nights of experimentation as i was, it was plain to see the black haired sorcerer was getting worried.

And seeing his friend look worried was sending my poor vessel into a tizzy. "B-but we can get it off, right?"

"I'm worried about the precision it would take, since the barrier is embedded in a part of your body."

"Oh, yeah, precision...." the brat shook his head. "That's definitely not my wheelhouse. But what about you?"

He let out a long breath. "...I really wouldn't wanna risk it. If it was a life or death situation I'd probably be willing to try but as is I'll probably only make it worse," he held up two fingers. "Which leaves us with two options. One, we find the people qualified to deal with this type of emergency. So Ieiri-sama, or Gojo."

"Isn't that the lady who cuts up dead people?..."

"I mean yeah, but she's still a really great doctor. Somebody needs to do autopsies."

The brat scratched a cheek. "It's a really weird hour, though... what's the other option?"

He sighed, glanced down at his lap as if gathering his thoughts. "The second option, right.." he looked back up, and straight at me. "Sukuna, could you stop cursing Itadori please?"

"Eh?"

"I've already informed him of my conditions. If this punk-ass wants to lose his dick, that's hardly my concern."

"Hang on /you/ did this??" I rolled my eye at his offended tone. What the fuck did he think?

"I'm calling Gojo."

This made us both start. He darted forward as Megumi poked at one of those slates everybody has, placing his hand over it. "No, don't!" After a moment he added, "Sukuna's supposed to be *my* responsibility. If I can't even deal with this, what're they going to think?" He stepped back, pure determination on his face. "I can handle it."

Megumi, to his credit, did not look fully convinced. "...look I get that it's embarrassing, but I /really/--"

"I'm not embarrassed! I just. Want to take care of it myself. I'm going to be the one with Sukuna in my head for the rest of my life, right?" He crossed his arms. "He's been talking way more lately," i de-materialized the mouth on his face to avoid frowning. So he /had/ noticed. "...so maybe it means he's going to do stuff like this in the future too. Shouldn't I try and learn to deal with that?"

After a moment, Megumi leaned back and rubbed his temples. "It's too damn early for this shit...." "...okay, you know what? Fine, you can... negotiate I guess--"

"Ah, dude, thank you so mu!--" He held up a hand.

"But you have to do it in here."

How could I pass that up? "Excellent! Wouldn't have pegged you for a voyeur, Megumi Fushiguro."

He raised a single eyebrow. "...excuse you?"

My vessel's face had gone red again. "Uhh oh, okay, so. Um, the, uh.. deal he was offering was to basically, um. Give me a blowjob? And I'd do the same to him?..."

"........." He took a deep breath. "...right. Okay. I am just... not going to ask how that's even possible.."

"There are advantages to being able to put a mouth on--"

He talked over me. "*Anyway!* I fail to see how that solves the problem."

"Huh? What'chya mean?"

Megumi gestured to our crotch. "You want to get rid of the barrier. And make sure that he doesn't make another one. How would a blowjob solve that?"

The brat held up a finger before stopping. "Shit, you're right!"

Megumi pulled his glowing slate thing out again. "I'm going to record this, so we can refer back to it later, ok?" The vessel nodded his assent. After a moment he placed the slate on a nearby table, sitting down and getting out a pen and notepad. "Ok, so, first things first--what exactly do you want, Itadori?"

Grabbing a chair offered by Megumi, he sat down as he pondered. As much as one can ponder anything when the inside of their mind is an empty field. "I guess.. well, like you said I don't want the barrier on my dick anymore. And I don't want any, um. Permanent damage...." he rolled his head over his shoulders, a tic that seemed to indicate when he was thinking about something. "Ah! And I don't want him to hurt me when, uh, we do the sex thing."

Megumi scribbled something down on a notepad. "Don't think the first one is a good condition. It's too specific--keep in mind you've got no idea how he cast that barrier in the first place. So it'd probably be easy to do the same thing again."

"Oh. Okay... so. I want to.. make sure he can't use that barrier ability at all?"

"Not on you, anyway."

"Okay, yeah, that makes sense."

"Sounds good to me," I interjected, startling him. Megumi wasn't put out.

"We're not done talking," He tapped the pen against the page. "Ok, so you want Sukuna to: 1)Not use this barrier technique on you at any point in the future, 2)heal any damage this may have caused, and 3)prevent any harm during these transactions."

"Uh. Sure... that sounds fine."

"And, Sukuna? What are your conditions?" He met my eye with the air of somebody very good at pretending they know what they're doing.

I had to admit, those were some cleverly worded conditions. That last one in particular.. either he'd gotten extremely lucky, or he'd deliberately foreseen and sidestepped some nasty possibilities I'd considered. Still, they /were/ kids trying to play the big leagues. "Let's say that.. I need to dispel the barrier through physical contact--upon completion, I agree not to use it on him again," I felt him shift a little in his seat. I think he knew what I meant by 'physical contact'. "He'll then need to bring me to orgasm via the embodiment technique I demonstrated earlier. Upon doing so, I shall consider this contract completed, and will not use the technique on him again."

Megumi had been busily scribbling down things. Annoying since it was an element of the situation I couldn't keep track of--but I was hardly about to say so. "Okay. You want, 1)to dispel the barrier through 'physical contact', and 2)for Itadori to make you" he sighed, "orgasm using.. some technique you've shown him. Is that correct?"

"Quite."

He tapped the pen against the pad. "The specific conditions you're willing to do those things under are that 1)As soon as the barrier currently on Itadori's body is gone, you won't use barrier techniques on him again, and 2)as soon as Itadori makes you orgasm, you won't do this other technique on him either. Accurate?"

"That is accurate. I'll agree to these conditions."

He frowned, then held up and tapped the pad where I presumed he had written the brat's wants. "Do you agree to the conditions that Itadori proposed?"

Tsk. Would've been an easy way to sidestep that 'no harm' rule. "Yeah, alright. He can't get hurt when we fuck."

My vessel interjected, "/And/ you need to heal any damage that's been caused, too!"

"Fine, fine, sheesh," I tried to sound at least a little bitter to cover up my triumph--As I'd suspected, they were so focused on their conditions they hadn't examined mine with nearly as much scrutiny.

Megumi scanned the paper again, and nodded. "Well. Good enough, I guess. Itadori, do you agree to abide by the conditions Sukuna laid out?"

He motioned to look at the notebook again, and I could sense his lips moving as he read it. Eventually, hesitantly, "...yeah. Okay, I agree to it, too."

A rush of Cursed Energy flowed through me, and I felt a chain snake itself around my soul. My vessel jumped--feeling the sensation for the first time certainly isn't the most pleasant of experiences. Megumi, meanwhile, snapped the notebook shut. "Okay, cool. Let's never do this again," He walked over to his door and opened it. "Now leave. I need sleep."

"Right, sorry.." As my vessel made his way out, he turned to the superior sorcerer and added, "Thank you, so much Fushiguro--I would've totally screwed that up if it was just me. Thanks for... you know, trusting me with this."

His lips twitched in the barest hint of a smile. "You're welcome. And yes, you probably would've screwed it up," And with that he shut the door.
