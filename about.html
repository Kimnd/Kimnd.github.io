  	<article>
      <p>Hello there, I'm Frankie Gallagher, a San Francisco based Computer Scientist focused primarily on User Interface and Experience design.</p>
      <p>I've always been fascinated with complex systems, even as a kid. Though I didn't know what they were called, I would spend hours making little sorting algorithms for decks of cards. There was real joy in discovering many years later that not only was there a word for the games I would play with myself as a kid, but that there were whole fields of study dedicated to understanding similar ideas!</p>
      <p>I intend to carry that joy with me through my career, and try and convey it to others. Instilling joy in a piece of software is my ultimate goal. Whether that's through making the code itself very readable, or by working to make the best possible experience for whoever uses that software.</p>
      <p>I hope you find your visit to my little corner on the interwebz pleasant!</p>

      <p>Complex systems have always been a point of fascination for Frankie</p>
  	  Hello there! This is my website, where I keep my portfolio, writings, and anything else that I think is worthy of showing off.

      Perhaps you're wondering 'Who are you again? What's your name?' And that's an excellent question! Frankie Gallagher is my most professional name, but there's a very good chance you know me by some other name. Fifth, Fred, Finn, and Fred are all recognized, as is Fiona, though it's worth noting that in the current release that term is deprecated.

      I am a soon-to-be Computer Science major of San Francisco State University, and an aspiring User Interface and Experience designer.

      I have a variety of interests.
      - Writing is my main hobby, and while I can't showcase all of it in a professional setting, the time I've dedicated to it has honed my skills quite a bit.
      - Education is a deep passion of mine, going back to my time in middle school. Helping people understand things is something I take very seriously.
      - Eight years of Mandarin
