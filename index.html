        <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Fif Gallagher, a recent Computer Science graduate from San Francisco State University.</p><p>I've always been fascinated with complex systems, even as a kid. Though I didn't know what they were called, I would spend hours making little sorting algorithms for decks of cards. There was real joy in discovering many years later that not only was there a word for the games I would play with myself as a kid, but that there were whole fields of study dedicated to understanding similar ideas! </p>
        <p>I intend to carry that joy with me through my career, and try and convey it to others. Maybe by making software that scales really well, distilling complex design requirements into understandable architectures, ensuring code is readable and easily understood by anybody, or by working with others on the beauty of computer science.</p>
<!--        My journey to the tech field wasn't.. obvious. As a kid I wasn't allowed to play video games (my mother predicted I would become addicted to them), and in elementary school I somehow managed to render our blocky desktop computer unresponsive by downloading screensavers. So technology wasn't an obvious career path for me.
But somethings I /was/ fascinated by as a kid were adjacent to CS. I remember spending many hours shuffling and re-sorting playing cards, trying to figure out how to make the process involve as little effort from me as possible. The process I landed on was to flip through each card one by one and ask a question of each card within that mini-deck:
        <ol>What color is this card?</ol>
        <ol>Which suit?</ol>
        <ol>Is it a face card?</ol>
        <ol>Is it the biggest card?</ol>
        Realizing many years later that I had independently thought of sorting algorithms without knowing what they were was a real joy.

        All this to basically say that I was always fascinated by /systems/. Airports, Rube Goldberg machines, those cutaway diagrams with 3d models of life in middle-age castles... in hindsight, all these interests poised me to love the theoretical side of computer science.

        Making code readable, modular, and scalable are the things I find fascinating. But to me, what's great about computer science is its ability to put complex ideas into a framework not only for discussion, but to make it tangible. That's what I hope to accomplish in my career.

        <div id="educationHire">
          <p>I've worked in education for many years, as far back as middle school. My extensive experience includes:</p>
          <ul>Working directly with the writer of the SFUSD's Computer Science curriculum and website</ul>
          <ul>Providing  assistance in a 5th grade classroom, helping to manage the students as well as providing tutoring in mathematics</ul>
          <ul>Advocating for students with learning disabilities for many years by speaking at panels and serving as a volunteer at EdRev</ul>
          <p>In general, I have a passion for learning how best to convey ideas to others. Even outside education, communicating ideas to others is a widely applicable skill, and one that I relish improving.</p>

        <div id="softwareHire">
          <p>My experience working with software is, by its nature, limited mostly to my time in college. But what I have done has prepared me well for the working world.</p>
          <ul>CSC648 class--worked well on a 6-person team, documentation was very presentable, coding standards</ul>
          <ul>CSC415--worked on team of 'four', focusing on usability and clean code</ul>
          <ul>generally passionate about code that's readable, modular, and scalable</ul>
          <p>I'll be the first to admit that I don't focus on making my code the most feature rich, or the best optimized. But making an architecture that will scale well, and code that's very readable? That's my greatest strength.</p>
